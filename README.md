# New-Wheels
## Business Context:

A lot of people in the world share a common desire: to own a vehicle. A car or an automobile is seen as an object that gives the freedom of mobility. Many are now preferring pre-owned vehicles because they come at an affordable cost, but at the same time, they are also concerned about whether the after-sales service provided by the resale vendors is as good as the care you may get from the actual manufacturers. New-Wheels, a vehicle resale company, has launched an app with an end-to-end service from listing the vehicle on the platform to shipping it to the customer's location. This app also captures the overall after-sales feedback given by the customer. 

## Problem Statement:

The CEO of the company now wants a quarterly report with all the key metrics sent to him so he can assess the health of the business and make the necessary decisions.
